# Upcoming Movies IMDB

## Architecture

First of all, I analyzed the IMDB API and the endpoints, to know which datas they return.

Then I structured the backend layer and after that, built the frontend layer to request the data from my API.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get running

Clone this repository

Backend
```
cd imdb-api
npm install
npm run start
```


# Backend 
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - To build HTTP server
* [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - A module to store configuration in environment separate from code
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - HTTTP Client to make http requests
